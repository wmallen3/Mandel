# Mandel
Java AWT drawing exercise.

This is an implementation of an exercise I created for myself
to understand the basics of Eclipse, AWT, and Java classes.
The program will draw a Mandelbrot set using recursive subdivision.
The user can double-click on a point in the picture to zoom.

This is not an example of a complete project.  This is just here
to help me understand what needs to be done to put this on git.
